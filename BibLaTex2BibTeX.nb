the anatomic and dynamic information from real {MR} acquisitions. {PET} \

lesions. {PET} projection data and images are simulated using analytic \
forward projections (including attenuation and Poisson statistics) \
implemented within the image reconstruction package {STIR.} {PET} image \
reconstructions are also performed with {STIR.} The simulation is validated \
with numerical simulation based on Monte Carlo ({GATE)} which uses more \
accurate physical modelling, but has 150\[Times] slower computation time \
compared to the analytic method for ten respiratory positions and is 7000\
\[Times] slower when performing multiple realizations. Results are validated \
in terms of region of interest mean values and coefficients of variation for \
65 million coincidences including scattered events. Although some discrepancy \
is observed, agreement between the two different simulation methods is good \
given the statistical noise in the data. In particular, the percentage \
difference of the mean values is 3.1\\\\% for tissue, 17\\\\% for the lungs \
and 18\\\\% for a small lesion. The utility of the procedure is demonstrated \
by simulating realistic {PET-MR} datasets from multiple volunteers with \
different breathing patterns. The usefulness of the toolkit will be shown for \
performance investigations of the reconstruction, motion correction and \
attenuation correction algorithms for dynamic {PET-MR} data.},\\n\\tlanguage \

data is a common target for visual analytics, as they appear in a wide range \
of application domains. Typical tasks in analyzing time-series data include \
identifying cyclic behavior, outliers, trends, and periods of time that share \
distinctive shape characteristics. Many methods for visualizing time series \
data exist, generally mapping the data values to positions or colors. While \
each can be used to perform a subset of the above tasks, none to date is a \
complete solution. In this paper we present a novel approach to time-series \
data visualization, namely creating multivariate data records out of short \
subsequences of the data and then using multivariate visualization methods to \
display and explore the data in the resulting shape space. We borrow ideas \
from text analysis, where the use of N-grams is a common approach to \
decomposing and processing unstructured text. By mapping each temporal N-gram \
to a glyph, and then positioning the glyphs via PCA (basically a projection \
in shape space), many different kinds of patterns in the sequence can be \
readily identified. Interactive selection via brushing, in conjunction with \
linking to other visualizations, provides a wide range of tools for exploring \
the data. We validate the usefulness of this approach with examples from \
several application domains and tasks, comparing our methods with traditional \
time-series visualizations.},\\n\\tlanguage = {en},\\n\\tnumber = \
